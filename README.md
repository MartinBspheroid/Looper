# Looper

This is WIP repo for personal addon to [Cinder](libcinder.org), currently slowly embracing beauty of new glNext API. 

What this ~~does~~ should do:

  - Passing input (currently as _float_) through when recording
  - When recording is stopped, automaticly take over and playback recorded data
   

   ##### Have extra functions in future :
  - getting offseted data from buffer
  - re-recoring
  - mixing with input (dry/wet)
  - using std::signals functionality
  - stretching, shrinking, nudging forward/backward
  - quantizingclose
  - smoothing input
  - inverting buffer
  - using templates to get more generic behavior

### Todos

Well, where can I start....
